# Walmart Data Analysis: SQL + Python

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Project Steps


### 1. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 2. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 3. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 4. Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 5. Load Data into MySQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in both MySQL and PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 6. SQL Analysis: Business Problem Solving
   - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
   - Identifying best-selling product categories.
   - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
   - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
   - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
